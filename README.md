# Museoscript

Museoscript is a bash script designed to identify museum specimens using illumina sequencing data. More in details, this script takes as input raw illumina reads and, after trimming and quality checking, aligns them to a set of reference sequences with vsearch, using an user-provided similarity threshold.
